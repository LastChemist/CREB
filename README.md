# CREB
CREB stands for Chemical Reaction Equation Balancer, I am attempting to recreate a program to perform it.

# Features:
  - Balancing complex equations using solving Linear Equations Sytem method (the basis of the balancing of every chemical reaction equation)
# Upcoming features:
  - Detection of impossible reactions
  - Typo detection
  - Solving complicated formulas with multiple itreated element symbols (e.g. CH3COOH) and parenthesis (e.g. (NH4)Al(SO4)2)
  - GUI (Graphical User Interface)

# Project development process
The development is being accelarated due to finishing my exams

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute and share your Ideas! and or improve the code via comment or refactors (*smile)
